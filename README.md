**Godot 4.x Button Example**

*Made with love and passion for my friend Bender*

A demonstration project showcasing interactive button mechanics in Godot 4.x. This project features a physical button implementation and player controller system for testing and interacting with button objects in a 3D environment.

**Project Structure**

The project is organized into modular components:

- modules/phys_button - Contains the physical button logic with GDScript implementation for button behavior and interaction
- modules/player_controller - Includes player controller scripts and a player prefab for character movement and button interaction
- prefabs/button0 - Holds the 3D model assets and scene file for the button object
- scenes/test.tscn - Main test scene demonstrating the button and player controller in action
- textures/ - Contains development grid textures for visual reference

**Features**

- Physical button implementation with GDScript
- Player controller with movement and interaction capabilities
- Modular project structure for easy component reuse
- Test scene for demonstrating button functionality
- 3D assets including button model and developer textures

**Getting Started**

Open the project in Godot 4.x and run the test scene to see the button interaction in action. The player controller allows you to move around and interact with the physical button, demonstrating collision detection and response.
